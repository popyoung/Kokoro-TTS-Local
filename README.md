# Kokoro TTS Local

A local implementation of the Kokoro Text-to-Speech model, featuring dynamic module loading, automatic dependency management, and a web interface.

## Features

- Local text-to-speech synthesis using the Kokoro-82M model
- Multiple voice support with easy voice selection (31 voices available)
- Automatic model and voice downloading from Hugging Face
- Phoneme output support and visualization
- Interactive CLI and web interface
- Voice listing functionality
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Real-time generation progress display
- Multiple output formats (WAV, MP3, AAC)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- FFmpeg (optional, for MP3/AAC conversion)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster generation)
- Git (for version control and package management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The system will automatically download required models and voice files on first run.

## Usage

You can use either the command-line interface or the web interface:

### Command Line Interface

Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
python tts_demo.py
```

The CLI provides an interactive menu with the following options:
1. List available voices - Shows all available voice options
2. Generate speech - Interactive process to:
   - Select a voice from the numbered list
   - Enter text to convert to speech
   - Adjust speech speed (0.5-2.0)
3. Exit - Quit the program

Example session:
```
=== Kokoro TTS Menu ===
1. List available voices
2. Generate speech
3. Exit
Select an option (1-3): 2

Available voices:
1. af_alloy
2. af_aoede
3. af_bella
...

Select a voice number (or press Enter for default 'af_bella'): 3

Enter the text you want to convert to speech
(or press Enter for default text)
> Hello, world!

Enter speech speed (0.5-2.0, default 1.0): 1.2

Generating speech for: 'Hello, world!'
Using voice: af_bella
Speed: 1.2x
...
```

### Web Interface

For a more user-friendly experience, launch the web interface:

```bash
python gradio_interface.py
```

Then open your browser to the URL shown in the console (typically http://localhost:7860).

The web interface provides:
- Easy voice selection from a dropdown menu
- Text input field with examples
- Real-time generation progress
- Audio playback in the browser
- Multiple output format options (WAV, MP3, AAC)
- Download options for generated audio

   - Install FFmpeg for MP3/AAC support
   - Try different output formats

4. **Voice File Issues**
   - Delete and let system redownload voice files
   - Check `voices/` directory permissions
   - Verify voice file integrity
   - Try using a different voice

5. **Web Interface Issues**
   - Check port 7860 availability
   - Try different browser
   - Clear browser cache
